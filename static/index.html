      Animal Shogi is a board game. The aim is to capture the opponent's lion,
      or get your lion to the end of the board!
    </p>
    <p>
      On your turn, you can move a piece one square, in a direction shown by its
      red dots.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you capture an opponent's piece, it goes into your bench. Instead of
      moving a piece, you can play a piece from your bench anywhere on the
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your chick moves to the end of the board, it becomes a more powerful
      hen!
